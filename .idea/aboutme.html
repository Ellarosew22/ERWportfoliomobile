        <p> Hi there! I am so grateful that you have taken the time to explore my portfolio!
          My first name is a double-barrel name but with no hypen, so please call me Ella Rose!
          I started my design journey by being inspired by chinese characters while I attended an immersion
          Chinese school.
        </p>

          Since, I have not only further developed my langauge skills, but also have adapted to using both English
          and Chinese in my work.
          I am looking forward to continuing developing more work in Chinese, and exploring how both cultures can
          interact within design.
          I am currently broading my horizons and have been working on a wood working project with my grand
          father, building
          an electric guitar. Through this, I have been applying my knowledge of design and composition in a new
          medium,
          which has been enticing in the aspect of growing my understanding of the profession and creaitve world!
        </p>

        <p>
          I am currently studying Graphic Design and Chinese at the Univeristy Of Minnesota- Twin Cities.
          I transferred from political science and have since been astonished by how much I enjoy my work.
          I one day want to work internationally between the US and China, or any Mandarin speaking country.
          If you look at my digital and physical work pages, make sure to check out how I have started to incorporate
          my passion for Chinese! I am looking for clients who would like to work with both langauges, or any new ones!
          I am eager to learn about your story as you have learned mine. Contact me and let's talk!
